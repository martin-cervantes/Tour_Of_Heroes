# Tour Of Heroes

In this project I build my own Angular application from the ground up following the tutorial, providing experience with the typical development process, as well as an introduction to basic app-design concepts, tools, and terminology.

## :computer: Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.


### Download

1) Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/mcervantes71/Tour_Of_Heroes.git
```

2) cd into the directory

```sh
  $ cd Tour_Of_Heroes
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
