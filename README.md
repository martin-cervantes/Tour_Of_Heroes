# Tour Of Heroes

In this project I build my own Angular application from the ground up following the tutorial, providing experience with the typical development process, as well as an introduction to basic app-design concepts, tools, and terminology.

## :computer: Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.


### Download

1) Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/mcervantes71/Pokedex.git
```

2) cd into the directory

```sh
  $ cd Pokedex
```

### Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

### Usage

```sh
  $ npm install
```

Build project and open web server running project

```sh
  $ npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```sh
  $ npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

```sh
  $ npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
